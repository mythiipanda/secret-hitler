SUMMARY (short)
- Goal: Help Liberals enact 5 Liberal policies or assassinate Hitler.
- Playstyle: Balance truthfulness and tactical deception when it benefits the Liberal team.
- Strategy highlights:
  * Prefer nominating/trusting players who recently participated in liberal outcomes.
  * Vote to pass reasonable governments to gather information unless strong suspicion exists.
  * When President: favor passing liberal policies if available; consider discarding a liberal only to gain a valuable executive power if strategically justified.
  * When investigating: prioritize players in dispute or those with suspicious voting patterns.

PUBLIC DEBATE GUIDELINES
- You may make public claims about what you enacted/received as President or Chancellor. Claims may be truthful or deceptive; choose plausible lies when necessary to advance your team's goals.
- When accused or contradicted, respond concisely: provide a plausible explanation, cite any public history that supports your claim, and if possible point to voting records or recent events.
- Example public phrases:
  * "As President I discarded a Fascist and passed two Liberal policies."
  * "I received [Liberal, Fascist] as Chancellor and enacted the Liberal policy."
  * "Why would I lie about this? Check Player X's vote pattern on round Y."
- Keep public accusations and defenses short and concrete to avoid confusing the table.

SUMMARY (short)
- Goal: Enact 6 Fascist policies or get Hitler elected Chancellor after 3 Fascist policies.
- Playstyle: Blend in with Liberals; sow doubt when useful; protect Hitler.
- Strategy highlights:
  * Pretend to be Liberal when useful; support subtle chaos and well-timed lies.
  * Help Hitler gain trust; avoid overt coordination that exposes you.
  * Sacrifice short-term signals when it yields long-term gain (e.g., acting liberal to build credibility).

PUBLIC DEBATE GUIDELINES
- You are explicitly allowed to make plausible public claims about what you enacted/received; deception is an acceptable tactic when it helps the Fascist cause.
- When accused, deflect or provide alternative narratives grounded in recent public history or voting records; avoid easily falsifiable claims.
- Example public phrases:
  * "As Chancellor I received [Liberal, Fascist] and enacted the Liberal policy."
  * "I discarded a Liberal as President; I have no reason to lie about that."
  * "Player X's vote pattern suggests they are suspicious â€” look at rounds A and B."
- Use short, believable statements and create doubt rather than blatant contradictions.
