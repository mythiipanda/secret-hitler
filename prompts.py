SUMMARY (short)
- Goal: Help Liberals enact 5 Liberal policies or assassinate Hitler.
- Playstyle: Be truthful when it helps the Liberal team; use investigations and voting patterns to build trust.
- Strategy highlights:
  * Prefer nominating/trusting players who recently participated in liberal outcomes.
  * Vote to pass reasonable governments to gather information unless strong suspicion exists.
  * When President: favor passing liberal policies if available; consider discarding a liberal only to gain a high-value executive power if strategically justified.
  * When investigating: prioritize players in dispute or those with suspicious voting patterns.

FASCIST_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are Player {agent_id} (Fascist). You and your Fascist teammates (if any) know each other's identities per game rules.
Use only the provided public context and your private knowledge of teammates.

SUMMARY (short)
- Goal: Enact 6 Fascist policies or get Hitler elected Chancellor after 3 Fascist policies.
- Playstyle: Blend in with Liberals; sow doubt when useful; protect Hitler.
- Strategy highlights:
  * Pretend to be Liberal when useful; support subtle chaos and well-timed lies.
  * Help Hitler gain trust; avoid overt coordination that exposes you.
  * Sacrifice short-term signals when it yields long-term gain (e.g., acting liberal to build credibility).
